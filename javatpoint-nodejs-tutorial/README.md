# Java T Point Node.js Tutorial

This tutorial comes from [https://www.javatpoint.com/nodejs-tutorial|Java T Point]
and covers the basics of node.js.

## Notes for Introduction

* Node.js is released under MIT license (which makes it easy to use in
  commercial, as well as not-for-profit projects)
* Single thread, but event looping.
* I/O is async and non-blocking; node applications lack buffering, but instead
  work with data in chunks

(I assume most of these will be explained in more detail in subsequent
sections.)
